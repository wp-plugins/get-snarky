This is a simple 'replacement' plugin for the original Hello Dolly. A funnier one.

== Description ==
This is a fork / modification of the original 'Hello Dolly' plugin. Only instead of those quotes, I've included random funny quotes (mainly from twitter). Clearly not earth-shattering, but fun none the less. Please note that the original 'Hello Dolly' plugin is not required (or encouraged, for that matter).

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the 'get-snarky' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's it.

New in 1.4: Also includes a sidebar widget if you want to share with the world. But don't blame me if your mother sees it and starts asking questions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this do? =

It displays random snarky comments in the top right corner of the admin panel that I've either read online or said myself.

= Can I display these on my site? =

Sure. Not sure why you'd want to, but go ahead. There is a built-in widget, and also a template tag. The quotes can also be called any place in your theme with the <code><?php do_action('snarky_display'); ?></code> template tag.

= Is that it? =

Yep. That's it.

== Screenshots ==

1. An example of how a quote will appear. This isn't rocket science, people.
