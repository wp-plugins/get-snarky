Stable tag: 1.42

This is a simple 'replacement' plugin for the original Hello Dolly. It's just funnier.

== Description ==
This is a fork / modification of the original 'Hello Dolly' plugin. Only instead of those quotes, I've included random funny quotes (mainly from twitter). Clearly not earth-shattering, but fun none the less. Please note that the original 'Hello Dolly' plugin is not required (or encouraged, for that matter).

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the 'get-snarky' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's it.

New in 1.4: Also includes a sidebar widget if you want to share with the world. But don't blame me if your mother sees it and starts asking questions. The quotes can also be called any place in your theme with the <code><?php echo display_snarky(); ?></code> function.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this do? =

It displays random snarky comments in the top right corner of the admin panel that I've either read online or said myself.

= Is that it? =

Yep. That's it.

== Screenshots ==

1. An example of how a quote will appear. This isn't rocket science, people.
