This is a simple 'replacement' plugin for the original Hello Dolly. It's just funnier.

== Description ==
This is a fork / modification of the original 'Hello Dolly' plugin. Only instead of those quotes, I've included random funny quotes (mainly from twitter). Clearly not earth-shattering, but fun none the less. Please note that the original 'Hello Dolly' plugin is not required (or encouraged, for that matter).

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the 'get-snarky' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's it. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this do? =

It displays random snarky comments in the top right corner of the admin panel that I've either read online or said myself.

= Is that it? =

Yep. That's it.
